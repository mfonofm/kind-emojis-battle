# Kind Emojis Battle 🎮

A 1–2 player browser game about spreading kindness.

Built with my daughter, this playful emoji battle lets you create your own character and compete by throwing emojis over the wall.

Play against the computer or challenge another player locally. First to 10 points wins each level. Complete all 5 levels to win the game.

The game is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), so it can be installed and played like a native app.
